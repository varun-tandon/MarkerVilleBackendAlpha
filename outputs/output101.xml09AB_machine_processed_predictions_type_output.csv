Vaults, the largest known ribonucleoprotein complex in eukaryotic organisms, derive their name from their multiple-arched morphology reminiscent of vaulted ceilings in gothic cathedrals.8-10 Native vaults appear as hollow, thin-walled sub-100 nm ellipsoidal structures with well-defined monodispersity, uniform NP size of 67 nm x 40 nm x 40 nm, and mass of ~13 MDa.11,12 Native vaults consist of multiple copies of three different proteins: the major vault protein (MVP, 100 kDa), vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (VPARP, 193 kDa), and telomerase-associated protein 1 (TEP1, 290 kDa) along with several copies of one or more small untranslated vault-associated RNA (vRNAs).8,9 MVP constitutes ~75% of the native vault particle mass, and exogenous expression of MVP alone in insect cells is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of hollow vault-like particles that are morphologically identical to native vaults, but lack VPARP, TEP1, and vRNA.13 Native and recombinant vaults consist of 78 copies of MVP (39 per half vault), which begin by protruding internally into the vault lumen at the NP waistline and then proceed to run lengthwise toward either vault cap, where they become externally solvent exposed.11,14,15 Novel recombinant MVP-only vaults have been created that not only retain native vault architecture but also incorporate a variety of functionalities internally and/or externally.7 Additionally, the use of an MVP interaction domain (INT, 17 kDa) derived from the C-terminus of VPARP has allowed for novel vault formation.",MVP,RNA,-1

Vaults, the largest known ribonucleoprotein complex in eukaryotic organisms, derive their name from their multiple-arched morphology reminiscent of vaulted ceilings in gothic cathedrals.8-10 Native vaults appear as hollow, thin-walled sub-100 nm ellipsoidal structures with well-defined monodispersity, uniform NP size of 67 nm x 40 nm x 40 nm, and mass of ~13 MDa.11,12 Native vaults consist of multiple copies of three different proteins: the major vault protein (MVP, 100 kDa), vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (VPARP, 193 kDa), and telomerase-associated protein 1 (TEP1, 290 kDa) along with several copies of one or more small untranslated vault-associated RNA (vRNAs).8,9 MVP constitutes ~75% of the native vault particle mass, and exogenous expression of MVP alone in insect cells is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of hollow vault-like particles that are morphologically identical to native vaults, but lack VPARP, TEP1, and vRNA.13 Native and recombinant vaults consist of 78 copies of MVP (39 per half vault), which begin by protruding internally into the vault lumen at the NP waistline and then proceed to run lengthwise toward either vault cap, where they become externally solvent exposed.11,14,15 Novel recombinant MVP-only vaults have been created that not only retain native vault architecture but also incorporate a variety of functionalities internally and/or externally.7 Additionally, the use of an MVP interaction domain (INT, 17 kDa) derived from the C-terminus of VPARP has allowed for novel vault formation.",VPARP,protein,-1

The unique optical and electromagnetic properties of plasmonic nanomaterials have generated interest in using these materials for a variety of applications in medicine ranging from clinical diagnostics and imaging to targeted tumor therapy.1-5 The strong scattering and absorption properties of plasmonic nanomaterials have led to the development of highly sensitive plasmonic biosensors for detecting glucose from biofluids, epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) on human cancer cells, amyloid beta from blood, and cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's Disease, and human papilloma virus DNA.6-12",EGFR,virus,-1
