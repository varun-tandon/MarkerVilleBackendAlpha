The 5 year survival rate of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has remained unchanged despite significant progress for other major cancers.1 One of the contributing reasons of the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer is the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, including gemcitabine (GEM), which is frequently used as first-line therapy.2,3 This resistance could result from acquired and/or intrinsic pathways, a dense dysplastic stroma that acts as a barrier to vascular perfusion and drug permeability, as well as unfavorable GEM pharmacokinetics as a result of insufficient activation or rapid inactivation.3 Recent progress in pancreatic cancer therapy has been the introduction of stromal-directed agents that obliterate the dense stromal microenvironment and improve chemotherapy drug delivery.",GEM,gemcitabine,1

","Interestingly, nonspecific targeting of the hyaluronan-nanoparticles at pH 7.4 was 15-fold lower than that from a related acid-labile PEG-LbL architecture with a pH-sensitive iminobiotin linker previously designed in our group to release a PEG shielding layer and ""unveil"" positively charged surfaces (Supporting Information Figure S1a).19 These findings are consistent with the notion that mucopolysaccharide-coated (i.e., HA-terminal) surfaces can exhibit antifouling behavior to prevent protein opsonization.49 Hypoxic pH-specific delivery of the hyaluronan-LbL architecture (pH 6.0 v 7.4) was likewise improved 2.5-fold relative to the previous iminobiotin architecture (Supporting Information Figure S1b) in Hep G2 cells, indicating enhanced cellular delivery at pH values reflective of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.",PEG,hyaluronan,1
