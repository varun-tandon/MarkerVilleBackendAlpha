","Here, we incorporate
gelatin into the bead matrix to allow protein-based components to
be covalently conjugated to the matrix using the enzyme microbial
transglutaminase (mTG).50-52 Figure 2a shows that mTG catalyzes the grafting of proteins to gelatin through
a glutamine (Gln) residue of one protein and a lysine (Lys) residue
of the other protein.45,53 Often, the residues (Gln or Lys)
of target proteins with globular structures are inaccessible for mTG
catalysis and thus target proteins are commonly engineered with short
fusion tags that provide accessible amino acid residues.54,55

","Due to their
elevated activity and expression in several forms of cancer, KDM1
and -4 proteins are recognized as oncogenes.10,11 KDM1 is, among others, associated with prostate, bladder, and estrogen-receptor-negative
breast cancer.12 The KDM4 family of histone
demethylases has repeatedly been shown to be involved in progression
of hormone dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer through
coregulating hormone receptors.13-15 The development of selective
KDM1 or -4 inhibitors is impeded by the high structure and sequence
conservation of these enzymes; most known inhibitors mimic either
the FAD cofactor (KDM1) or 2-OG through Fe(II)-binding (KDM4) and
hence interact with a plethora of other targets, such as 2-OG-dependent
oxygenases through iron chelation.16-19 The conjugation of iron chelating
compounds to the truncated histone peptide substrate has been investigated
as well,20,21 and it resulted in the discovery of the
first KDM4 selective inhibitors.",KDM1,iron,1

","Antimicrobial analysis was also
performed with bacteria grown in a biofilm using our previously published
model of catheter-associated biofilm formation with slight modifications.22 Briefly, 14-gauge fluorinated ethylene propylene
catheters (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) were cut into 0.5 cm segments,
sterilized, and coated in human plasma as previously described.28 Catheters were then placed in the wells of a
12-well microtiter plate containing 2 mL of TSB supplemented with
glucose and sodium chloride (biofilm medium, BFM).28 Each well was then inoculated with the MRSA strain LAC
at an OD560 of 0.05, and the plate was incubated at 37
degC for 24 h. To treat catheters with our various nanoconstruct
formulations, catheters were rinsed in sterile PBS and transferred
to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate.",PBS,sodium chloride,1

imaging of angiogenesis can allow for much earlier cancer diagnosis

of blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen and to remove waste
products.4 A number of growth factor receptor

endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins and receptors
is an integral member.5 Research also showed
that activation of the VEGF pathway could trigger a signaling cascade
that promotes endothelial cell growth and migration from pre-existing

knockdown resulted in an increased immunostaining of pAKT in immature
post-mitotic neurons; overexpression of girdin was sufficient to elevate
levels of pAKT and pS6 without insulin stimulation, but this was antagonized
by coexpression of DISC1; while overexpression of DISC1 alone had
no effect on pAKT levels in either insulin stimulated or unstimulated
cells.70 This is in contrast to earlier
observations in cortical neurons, where DISC1 overexpression in unstimulated
cells resulted in an increase in pAKT.98 Girdin overexpressing neurons (thus increasing AKT signaling) exhibit

is most likely caused by the high electrolyte content which reduces
the electrostatic repulsion.47 In addition,
immediately after preparation, the DH of
all FFSNPs in protein-containing media was slightly larger than that
in pure water (Figure 2c,d,f), which is consistent
with the formation of a protein corona around the NPs.48 Small differences between the colloidal stability
of the five investigated FFSNPs in one type of protein-containing

Introduction
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are unable to adequately excrete phosphate, putting them at increased risk for cardiovascular mortality and metabolic bone disease.1 Optimal phosphate levels in dialysis patients cannot be achieved with dietary restriction, so oral phosphate binders are used.1,2 Lanthanum carbonate is a potent, non-calcium, non-aluminum phosphate binder.3",ESRD,Lanthanum,-1
