","Since heterogeneous marker expression is often found within
regions of a tumor, and further since no two cancers are identical,
it is unlikely that a single marker can be relied upon.4

As an alternative to biomarker targeting,
we have suggested that
the acidic environment within solid tumors may be exploited for targeting
by the pH (Low) Insertion Peptide (pHLIP) family.5 Malignant tumors exhibit elevated uptake and consumption
of glucose, as well as metabolite buildup and hypoxia due to inadequate
blood supply, leading to tumor acidosis from the Pasteur and Warburg
effects.6-8 As a result, the extracellular environment in virtually
all solid tumors is acidic (pH ~ 6.0-6.5),9,10 and more aggressive tumors are more acidic.11 Extracellular acidity may therefore be a general biomarker for targeting
malignant tumors.

was later deemed nonspecific since it could not be competed with the
free protein.18,20-22 Binding of
IgG from NOD mice to radiolabeled GAD65 has also been observed, but
again, binding could not be competed with free GAD65.21 Thus, the current consensus in the field is that NOD mice
do not have anti-GAD65 autoantibodies, which has resulted in speculation
that the NOD mouse model does not accurately reflect human T1DM.20",GAD65,serum,1
