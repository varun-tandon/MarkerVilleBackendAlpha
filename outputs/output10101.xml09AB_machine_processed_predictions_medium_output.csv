","The major findings of our study can be summarized as follows: 1) HIF-1a and Glut-1 are positively correlated in primary tumors without preoperative chemotherapy; 2) HIF-1a positively correlate with the leptin system in primary and metastatic breast cancer without preoperative chemotherapy; 3) the leptin system is not associated with Glut-1 expression in all studied groups; 4) Glut-1 correlates negatively with ERa in primary and metastatic tumors, regardless of preoperative chemotherapy; 5) hypoxia markers correlate positively with ERb expression in primary tumors, especially in the group without preoperative therapy; 6) Glut-1 expression is positively associated with Ki-67 in primary tumors, while in lymph node metastases, a trend toward positive correlation between these proteins is found in the group without therapy; 7) preoperative chemotherapy influences the associations between HIF-1a and leptin in primary and metastatic tumors, HIF-1a and ObR in metastatic tumors, HIF-1a and Glut-1 in primary tumors; Glut-1 and ERb in primary tumors; Glut-1 and Ki-67 in primary and metastatic tumors.
