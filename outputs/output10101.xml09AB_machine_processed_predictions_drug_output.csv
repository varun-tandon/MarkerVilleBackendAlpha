Proteins were transferred onto Bio Trace PVDF membrane (PALL Life Sciences; Pensacola, FL) at 42 V for 1.5 h. Blots were washed in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) for 5 min at room temperature, blocked for 1 h in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/T) plus 5% dry milk at room temperature and then washed three times in TBS/T. Blots were incubated overnight at 4degC with primary antibodies specific for IGF-1R (sc-9038), a-Enolase (sc-100812), GAPDH (sc-25778) (all from Santa Cruz Santa Cruz, CA), Ras (BD Biosciences, 610001) and Profilin (Millipore, AB3891) in TBS/T plus 5% dry milk.",T,BD,-1
