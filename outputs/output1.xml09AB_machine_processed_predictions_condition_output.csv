breast cancer, PAD2-catalyzed histone citrullination has
recently been implicated in the production of macrophage extracellular
traps (METs) in adipose tissue from obese mice.9 Given the emerging roles for extracellular traps in a range
of disease states and the universal role of macrophages in promoting
inflammation, further demonstration of the requirement for PAD2-mediated
histone deimination in MET production suggests that PAD2 inhibitors
may prove to be ideal therapeutics for a range of inflammatory diseases.

Introduction
Surgical intervention
is currently the most common treatment for
virtually all types of solid tumors.1,2 A successful
outcome is therefore contingent upon the complete removal of all cancer
cells from both the affected primary organ and from potential metastatic
sites during surgery.3 Contrast agents
that target specific biomarkers in cancers can be used as intraoperative
contrast agents to guide surgical resection of solid tumors in order
to improve treatment outcome.4,5 Among the diverse imaging
modalities, optical-based techniques utilizing fluorescent contrast
agents have great potential.6,7 Indocyanine green (ICG),
fluorescein, methylene blue, and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) are
all nontargeted contrast agents that are currently used as injectable
enhancers for the visualization of various tumors.8,9 In
addition, several targeted contrast agents are in various stages of
clinical development.10",ICG,cancer,-1

imaging of angiogenesis can allow for much earlier cancer diagnosis

of blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen and to remove waste
products.4 A number of growth factor receptor
pathways form the molecular basis of angiogenesis, of which the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins and receptors
is an integral member.5 Research also showed
that activation of the VEGF pathway could trigger a signaling cascade
that promotes endothelial cell growth and migration from pre-existing
vasculature.6 Due to its well-established
role in angiogenesis, radiolabeled ligands, such as VEGF121, bevacizumab, etc., which target the VEGF receptor (i.e., VEGFR),

The role of S704/C704 in brain structure has
received considerable attention, with the C704 allele being associated
with increased volumes of several brain regions.98,99 Variation of amino acid 704 also appears to affect gray matter volume,
including parahippocampal formations,98,100,101 as well as affecting white matter integrity.102 Functional imaging studies have shown S704
homozygotes to have decreased hippocampal activation during memory
tests, greater hippocampal and paracampal activation during memory
encoding, and greater prefrontal cortex activation during verbal fluency
